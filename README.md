2. **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add your API key:

```

OPENAI\_API\_KEY=your\_openai\_api\_key\_here

````

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share this key** or upload your `.env` file!

3. **Install the required packages**:

## üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
blog-generator/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog_generator.py     # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore            # Tells Git to ignore .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Your API key (NOT uploaded to GitHub)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

---

## üîê Security Notice

The `.env` file contains your private API key and **must never be uploaded to GitHub**.
That's why it's listed in `.gitignore`.

If your key was accidentally committed once, remove it from your history or regenerate it from OpenAI's dashboard.
