## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
blog-generator/
│
├── blog_generator.py     # Main script
├── .gitignore            # Tells Git to ignore .env
├── .env                  # Your API key (NOT uploaded to GitHub)
└── README.md             # This file
```

---

## 🔐 Security Notice

The `.env` file contains your private API key and **must never be uploaded to GitHub**.
That's why it's listed in `.gitignore`.

If your key was accidentally committed once, remove it from your history or regenerate it from OpenAI's dashboard.
